            <h1>About me</h1>
            <br>    
            <p>I am an undergraduate student at the University of Maryland Baltimore County, majoring in Information Systems with an expected graduation in May 2026. When I began my college journey, I had no prior coding experience, unlike many of my peers. However, I quickly developed a passion for coding and the process of continuous learning that comes with it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am self-motivated and driven by a strong work ethic, always eager to expand my knowledge and skills. My passion for problem-solving pushes me to identify and close any knowledge gaps swiftly, enabling me to add value to any team I am part of.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I hold a Google Cyber Security Certification and am proficient in multiple languages, including English, Urdu, and Hindi. In addition to my technical skills, I enjoy watching sports. Some of my favorite teams are the Dallas Mavericks, Buffalo Bills, Houston Texans, Manchester City, and AlphaTauri.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am excited about the future and am continually seeking opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world challenges.</p>
